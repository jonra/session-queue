# Test status

What has been tested live, and what has not. Open test work is tracked in the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/niklasrichardson/session-queue/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Atesting). Back to the [README](../README.md).

## Not verified

These were not tested by `cargo test`, or not yet tested live:

- Anything on macOS. The code is checked by compiling it for macOS, but it has not run on a Mac.
- The exact cause of the 4 early watcher exits seen on 24 Oct 2026. They were not reproduced (40 runs of the Monitor's command form, 10 at a time, and 4 runs under the Monitor tool). Removing the parent check removes the only silent exit path that fits; a watcher that still ends early now prints its reason to stderr.
- That an orphaned watcher (one whose Monitor was killed) never delays work. It keeps the lock until `--max-seconds`; the new Monitor's `cq watch` exits 5 and the session re-arms with `--takeover`. In a test on 24 Oct 2026, stopping a Monitor with TaskStop killed the whole process tree, `cq.exe` included.
- The Claude Code CLI and Remote Control paths. Live tests used the desktop app's Code tab.
- The rejoin hook after a compaction or a resume. It was tested live after `/clear` only.
- Sending 25 tasks in a row with no person typing (test L3 in the spec).

Tested live in the desktop app on Windows: re-arming after each 30-minute watcher exit (hundreds of re-arms across 10 sessions), the rejoin hook after `/clear`, replies, rejections and multi-hop forwarding.
